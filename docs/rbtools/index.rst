RBTools Documentation
=====================

RBTools is a set of command line tools for working with `Review Board`_ and
RBCommons_. It's there to help quickly get your code up for review, check on
the status of changes, and eventually land your code in the codebase,
amongst other uses.

RBTools interfaces with your repository's official command line tools, making
it easy to generate suitable diffs or to apply changes across any supported
type of repository without having to learn different sets of tools.

Along with a variety of helpful commands, RBTools also provides a powerful
Python client API for Review Board, giving you the flexibility to develop your
own integrations.

What's in RBTools
=================

.. _rbt:

The "rbt" Command
-----------------

All the RBTools commands are invoked through the :command:`rbt` tool. This
runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS X, and contains a number of useful
sub-commands through the following usage:

.. code-block:: console

   $ rbt <command> [options] [<args>]

You can get help on :command:`rbt` or a sub-command in the following ways:

.. code-block:: console

   $ rbt help
   $ rbt help <command>
   $ rbt <command> --help

Some of the most commonly-used commands include:

* :ref:`rbt-post` - Posts changes to Review Board
* :ref:`rbt-diff` - Displays the diff that will be sent to Review Board
* :ref:`rbt-land` - Lands a change in a local branch or on a review request
